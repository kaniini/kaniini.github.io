One could argue that Atheme has not had a very good year for 2013.  In a lot of ways, this is because
what little precious time and energy I have to spend on free software has had to go to more important
and urgently required projects, such as pkgconf.

Though, it's not all been for nothing.  We actually *have* made good progress on the IRCv3 front in
many ways.  There's a real branch of UnrealIRCd 3.4 that exists now that you can download and play with,
the result of collaboration between Atheme and the UnrealIRCd crew.

But for all the progress that has been made, there has been many things that have not been done, and
really bring into question the status of Atheme as an organization.  Some examples are:

 * Atheme 7.1 *still* hasn't shipped.
 * Atheme 7.0.6 while being tagged was never actually shipped either.

So, for the 2013 - 2014 organizational year, we have selected jdhore as our new project leader.  His
platform is essentially to get us caught up and back to speed on the various sundry tasks that aren't
getting done.

This allows me to of course worry more about tasks outside of Atheme, which is arguably a good thing
with two startups on my plate right now.
