A [rabbit pretending to be a person](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therianthropy), kaniini is very strange.

You might find them in a forest, or something.  Unfortunately, it's more likely that you'll find them in a datacentre.

You might have seen or used their code in various popular and/or essential free software applications.

They started their own consultancy in October 2012 which expanded into virtualization after their dissatisfaction with
current market offerings.  In 2014 the virtualization business was sold to Centarra.

You may also have noticed that they have very strong opinions and express them directly.  If you cannot handle this,
it is suggested that you get very far away from them.

## kaniini's current projects

[Alpine Linux](http://www.alpinelinux.org) is a Debian-esque distribution featuring uClibc (musl on new architectures),
and a Busybox-based userland.  Unlike Debian, it provides truly advanced package management featuring completely up-front
configuration and a next-generation configuration management framework.

[atheme](http://www.atheme.org) is an organization which provides free software collaboration tools based on
[IRCv3](http://www.ircv3.org).

[kueventd](http://github.com/kaniini/kueventd) is a planned udev replacement.

[pkgconf](http://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf) is a pkg-config clone, used by FreeBSD, Alpine, Gentoo etc.

They also have [various things at their previous company](http://github.com/Centarra), mostly related to Xen and distribution
environment construction, network anomaly detection, etc.

## Previous notable projects

[audacious](http://www.audacious-media-player.org), a popular free software media player.

[dronebl](http://www.dronebl.org), a crowdsourced DNSBL which is fairly effective at stopping persistant threats related
to IRC and other realtime social media services.

Beyond that, they have written dozens of lesser hacks and have at one point been involved in both GNU and Debian.

## Why the third-person gender-unspecific pronouns?

Why not?  Do I have to justify everything to you?
