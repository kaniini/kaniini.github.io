A [rabbit pretending to be a person](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therianthropy), kaniini is very strange.

I have been heavily involved in the open source and free software world for over a decade.  Major interest areas of research and development include:

 * Communications and signalling infrastructure for communal groups; especially the IRC protocol,
 * Development of emulation libraries for audio playback (concerning SNES and PS1/PS2 audio),
 * Network anomaly detection and mitigation,
 * Replacement of complex userspace components with simpler alternatives that provide the same functionality,
 * Resource virtualization (and multi-tenant infrastructure management in general),
 * Software-defined and reproducible operating system template management,
 * Usage of BSD-family operating systems in industrial computing.

[pkgconf](http://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf), a project I lead development of, is a core component of nearly every modern embedded
development toolchain, as well as nearly half of the GNU/Linux and other UNIX-like systems presently deployed.

My work on IRC ranging from [atheme](http://www.atheme.net), [charybdis](http://www.stack.nl/~jilles/irc/#charybdis),
the [IRCv3](http://ircv3.github.io) client protocol standards, and modern IRC stacks such as [mammon](http://www.mammon.io) demonstrate
domain expertise concerning development on top of the IRC protocol stack.  Many IRC software packages contain smaller contributions from
me as well.

Research and development surrounding mitigation of network anomalies include development of [ddosmon](http://bitbucket.org/tortoiselabs/ddosmon) and
critical engineering input for several other open-source and proprietary detection and mitigation technologies.

## Contacting kaniini

The best way to contact me is via IRC, if my client is idle just leave a message and I will get back to you if necessary.

Business inquiries should be sent to [my business](http://tortois.es).  Depending on business requirements, other contact methods can be arranged of course.
